# Exploratory Data Analysis in Python
This will cover the process of exploring and analyzing data, from understanding what’s included in a dataset to incorporating exploration findings into a data science workflow.


Using data on unemployment figures and plane ticket prices, we’ll leverage Python to summarize and validate data, calculate, identify and replace missing values, and clean both numerical and categorical values.
Throughout the course, we’ll create beautiful Seaborn visualizations to understand variables and their relationships.


For example, we’ll examine how alcohol use and student performance are related. Finally, the will show how exploratory findings feed into data science workflows by creating new features, balancing categorical features,
and generating hypotheses from findings.


By the end of this, we’ll have the confidence to perform our own exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python.we’ll be able to explain our findings visually to others and suggest the next steps for gathering insights from 
our data!
